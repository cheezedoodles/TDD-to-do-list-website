# TDD-to-do-list-website
an example of to-do list website from the Percival's TDD book.
I've tried adapting code to a newer version of django, selenium etc.
but it came to the point where everything broke due to the ORM's incompatibility with older versions.
use it in a virtualenv with requirements.txt listed in repository.
