# TDD-to-do-list-website
an example of to-do list website from the Percival's TDD book.
I've tried adapting code to newer version of django, selenium etc.
but it came to the point where everything broke due to ORM's incompatibility with older versions.
use it in a virtualenv with requirements.txt listed in repository.
